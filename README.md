# CS255
The client, DriverPass, wanted to create a website that offers practice driving tests and sell packages of time driving with an instructor. The project included roles-based permissions, payment processors, databases, and scheduling systems. I did rather well in reading the interview transcript and outlining the wants and needs of the client. If I were to revise anything, it would be the diagrams and models that were created. They were somewhat cluttered and unaesthetically pleasing. I interpreted user needs by looking at what the users and clients were asking for, and extrapolating what was both possible and most satisfying to the users. When designing software, my approach is to break down a larger problem into many smaller ones. This allows me to create functional pieces of software that serve essentially as a skeleton for the program without having to fully finish it just to test. In the future, I may utilize different process models to gain a better understanding of how I can create something in the most efficient manner.
